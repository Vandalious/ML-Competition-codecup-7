This competition was held in two rounds.
- Round 1: Warmup and Unranked, meaning the scores did not get counted in final results. I have put the answers to the first 3 problems; the last problem was a copy-pasta from a kaggle problem and they messed up the data somehow and it just doesn't work.

- Round 2: The main and final round, with problems mostly concerning NLP field. Will upload the answer to them in the future.
